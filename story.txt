You are in a underground lab where a group of scientists were working
on a project. They were creating a new type of creatures.
They were experimenting on many type of organisms they
wanted to create a friendly and strong creature but
unfortunately created mindless monsters. The monsters
killed all the scientists and agents that were there
to help to scientists in any situation. Only you who
was not there being saved. But before you can understand
anything and contact to peoples outside for help, those
monsters have destroyed every thing including communication
instruments. Now you have to kill all the monsters as soon
as possible before they get out of the lab and harm civillians..
